# PulseGuard

PulseGuard is an API Monitoring and Incident Management Platform.

It lets teams register HTTP/HTTPS APIs, monitor their availability and response
time on a schedule, and manage the incidents raised when an API fails and
recovers.

---

## Current Status

**Stage 2 — MySQL Database Foundation**

The persistence foundation now exists: MySQL, Spring Data JPA, and Flyway
migrations that create the `users`, `projects`, `project_members`, `monitors`,
and `monitor_checks` tables, with JPA entities and repositories mapped onto
them.

There is still **no business functionality**. No authentication, no project or
monitor REST APIs, no scheduling, no monitoring engine, no incidents, and no
messaging. Nothing writes to these tables yet — they exist so later stages have
somewhere to put data.

Only the Control API talks to the database. The Monitor Worker deliberately has
no persistence dependencies until the stage that actually needs them.

```

The Monitor Worker is currently completely independent. It does not talk to the
Control API or the database, it holds no monitoring logic, and nothing calls it
except its own health endpoint. It exists now so that background monitoring work
has a home in later stages.

---

## Prerequisites

```text
Java 21
Node.js 18+
npm
MySQL 8 (running locally)
```

Maven is **not** required — both backend projects ship the Maven Wrapper
(`./mvnw`), which downloads the correct Maven version automatically.

---

## Database Setup

Local development requires a **locally installed MySQL 8 server**. PulseGuard
does not create databases for you — create it once, and Flyway takes over from
there:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pulseguard
    CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
    COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

Flyway creates and owns every table, index, and constraint inside that database.
It runs automatically each time the Control API starts, and Hibernate then
validates that the entity mappings match the migrated schema. Hibernate never
generates or alters the schema itself (`ddl-auto=validate`).

Migrations live in `backend/control-api/src/main/resources/db/migration` and are
applied in version order:

```text
V1__create_users.sql
V2__create_projects.sql
V3__create_project_members.sql
V4__create_monitors.sql
V5__create_monitor_checks.sql
```

Never edit a migration that has already been applied — add a new one.

## Repository Structure

│   │   └── src/main/

```

`backend/` is a plain folder, not a Maven aggregator. `control-api` and
`monitor-worker` are two fully independent Maven projects and can each be opened
on their own in IntelliJ IDEA.

---

## Running the Control API

The Control API needs database credentials. Supply them as environment
variables — never commit them:

```bash
export DB_URL="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pulseguard?connectionTimeZone=UTC&preserveInstants=true"
export DB_USERNAME="YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME"
export DB_PASSWORD="YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD"

cd backend/control-api
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Starts on <http://localhost:8080>. On startup Flyway applies any pending
migrations and Hibernate validates the schema, so a mapping that disagrees with
the database stops the application immediately with a clear error.

`DB_URL` defaults to the local `pulseguard` database if unset, but there is no
default username or password.

---

## Running the Monitor Worker

```bash
cd backend/monitor-worker
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Starts on <http://localhost:8081>.

---

## Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env      # only needed if you want to override defaults
npm install
npm run dev
```

Starts on <http://localhost:5173>.

The frontend reads the Control API location from `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. If no
`.env` file is present it falls back to `http://localhost:8080`. Do not commit
your own `.env` — only `.env.example` is tracked.

---

## Running Backend Tests

Each project is built separately:

```bash
cd backend/control-api
./mvnw clean verify
```

```bash
cd backend/monitor-worker
./mvnw clean verify
```

**No database is required to build or test.** The test suite is deliberately
limited to fast tests that need no external infrastructure — there is no
database integration-test scope in this project.

The consequence is that the schema is not covered by automated tests. Flyway
migrations and Hibernate schema validation are exercised by **starting the
Control API** against MySQL: if a migration is broken or an entity mapping
disagrees with the schema, startup fails.

---

## Building the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

---

## Configuration

Both backend applications read these optional environment variables:

| Variable          | Applies to  | Default                             | Purpose                    |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `SERVER_PORT`     | both        | `8080` / `8081`                     | HTTP port                  |
| `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` | Control API | `http://localhost:5173`             | Origin allowed by CORS     |
| `DB_URL`          | Control API | local `pulseguard` database         | JDBC URL                   |
| `DB_USERNAME`     | Control API | *(none — must be set)*              | MySQL user                 |
| `DB_PASSWORD`     | Control API | *(none — must be set)*              | MySQL password             |

The frontend reads:

| Variable            | Default                 | Purpose               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` | Control API base URL  |

Database credentials are the only secrets so far, and they are supplied through
the environment. Nothing sensitive is committed.

## Roadmap

Later stages will introduce, roughly in this order:

```text
Authentication
Project Management
Monitor Management
Monitoring Worker
Dashboard
Incident Management

Notifications
Docker
SonarQube
Jenkins
AWS
Kubernetes
Observability
```

The next stage is **Task 03 — Authentication and Project Management**.
